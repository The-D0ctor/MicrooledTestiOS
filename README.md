# MicrooledTestiOS

Simple application realised in Swift with SwiftUI that let the user create a to-do list.
The user car create a task, delete tasks and mark them as completed.


## Instructions
To execute the project simply open the *MicrooledTestiOS.xcodeproj* file in Xcode and run it with *command + R*.
You can then add a tasks by clicking on the *Add Task* button.
You can mark a task as completed/uncompleted by swiping to the right or deleting it by swiping to the left.


## Technical choices
For local data persistance I used SwiftData, it is the most recent official Apple framework for local data storage, it doesn't require external dependancies and minimal code
